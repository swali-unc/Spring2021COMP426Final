Author: Syed Ali
onyen: swali

This is a project that uses laravel to organize a model-view-controller (and more) design pattern in web development. For more information on laravel, check the About Laravel section.

This website is deployed to https://comp426.digital-haze.org/

Any NPCs that may potentially be similar to UNC professors is entirely coincidental.

Here are the points sought after:

20 Points- Beginners Luck- Used Twitch API for finding relevant streamers to our website

20 Points- Now we're cookin- Used COMP 426 class twitter API to share if people are playing

30 Points- With great power comes... great complexity?- A username, hashed and salted password, and session token system is entirely in place using MySQL as the database back-end.

30 Points- rEnder it- Tic-tac-toe is played using javascript api calls

10 Points- Autocomp- Searching the high scores list will dynamically autocomplete usernames in the database to help search


Total: 110

Here are points that aren't fully attained, but hoping for partial credit:

10 Points- Glutton for punishment- all of the css on this website is hand-made (although jquery-ui is installed, I ended up not using it to chase after this achievement), and it works well on mobile. The mobile client is not "top-notch," and works a lot better in landscape view than portrait, but it does work.

Potential Total: 120

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
